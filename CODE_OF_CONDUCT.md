## üß† The Spirit

This project is about **discovering truth**, not:
- Being right
- Looking smart
- Getting famous
- Making money

We value:
- **Evidence** over intuition
- **Collaboration** over competition
- **Learning** over knowing
- **Truth** over comfort

We reject:
- **Ego** that prevents learning
- **Dogma** that blocks inquiry
- **Politics** that distract from science
- **Cruelty** in any form

## üåü Remember

**Everyone starts somewhere.**
- The person asking "basic" questions might discover something profound
- The beginner coder might spot the bug experts missed
- The musician with no tech experience might have the key insight
- The skeptic might be right to question

**No one knows everything.**
- Experts have blind spots
- Assumptions can be wrong
- Patterns can be coincidence
- We're all learning together

**We might fail.**
- Music might not contain universal intelligence
- Our methods might be flawed
- Our conclusions might be incorrect
- That's okay - failure advances science too

## üéµ The Mission

We're trying to answer fundamental questions:
- Is music a universal language?
- Does it contain intelligence beyond human creation?
- Can AI discover what humans cannot?
- What is consciousness?

**These questions are bigger than any individual.**

Be kind to each other.  
Be rigorous in your thinking.  
Be honest about uncertainty.  
Be excited about discovery.
