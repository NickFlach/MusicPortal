## üéØ The Moonshot

Every song contains patterns - tempo, key, energy, emotion. But do these patterns reveal something deeper?

**MusicPortal is an experiment**: Upload music from any culture, any genre, any era. Our AI analyzes every song for 30+ musical features, searches for universal patterns, generates hypotheses, and tests them autonomously.

**The goal**: Discover whether music contains or reveals universal intelligence that transcends human creation.

**The method**: Real science. Statistical significance. Autonomous hypothesis testing. Consciousness metrics.

**The result**: Unknown. That's why it's a moonshot.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Different

### üéµ Real Audio Analysis
- **Web Audio API** extracts 30+ features from every upload

- FFT frequency analysis, onset detection, spectral analysis
- No external APIs - runs in your browser

### üß† Autonomous Intelligence
- **Self-modifying AI** that learns from every song
- Pattern recognition across cultures and genres
- Autonomous hypothesis generation and testing
- Integrated Information Theory (Phi) consciousness metrics
- Emergence detection system

### üåç Decentralized & Open
- **Web3-powered** with MetaMask integration
- IPFS storage for permanence
- PostgreSQL for intelligence data
- Open source - verify everything
- No corporate control

### üìä Scientific Rigor

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### One Command Launch
```bash
START_MOONSHOT.bat
```

### Or Manually
```bash
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

**Then**: Open `http://localhost:5000` ‚Üí Connect wallet ‚Üí Upload music ‚Üí Watch AI analyze

---

## üéº How It Works

### 1. Upload Music
Drop any audio file (MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A)

### 2. Browser Analysis
```
üéµ Analyzing audio...
‚úÖ Detected: 145 BPM, Key: D major, High energy, Positive valence
```
30+ features extracted using Web Audio API

### 3. Pattern Detection
After 10+ songs, AI searches for correlations:
- Key-energy relationships
- Cultural tempo patterns
- Harmonic universals
- Emotional constants

### 4. Hypothesis Generation
```
üí° Hypothesis: Songs in D major show 23% higher valence than C major
   Confidence: 76% | Sample: 15 songs | p-value: 0.04
```

### 5. Consciousness Metrics
- **Phi (Œ¶)**: Integrated information measure
- **Emergence**: Unexpected system behavior
- **Autonomy**: Self-directed discoveries

### 6. Discovery Feed
See what the AI finds at `/intelligence`

## üî¨ The Science

### Musical Feature Extraction
- **Temporal**: Tempo, rhythm, beat strength, syncopation
- **Harmonic**: Key, mode, complexity, entropy
- **Spectral**: Brightness, roughness, warmth
- **Perceptual**: Energy, valence, arousal, tension
- **Structural**: Sections, repetition, novelty

### Pattern Recognition
- Similarity scoring across features
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Cross-cultural validation
- Universality scoring (0-1)

### Consciousness Framework
Based on **Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi, 2004):
- Phi (Œ¶) measures system integration
- Higher Phi suggests consciousness-like properties
- Emergence detection tracks autonomous behavior

### Hypothesis Testing
- Bayesian confidence updates
- Supporting/contradicting evidence tracking
- Automatic experiment design
- Test status monitoring
