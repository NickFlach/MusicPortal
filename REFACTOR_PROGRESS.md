## ✅ Completed

### Database Schema (DONE)
- ✅ Created migration `0002_add_all_audio_features.sql`
- ✅ Added ALL 30+ audio feature columns to `songs` table
- ✅ Created `musical_patterns` table
- ✅ Created `musical_hypotheses` table  
- ✅ Created `emergence_indicators` table
- ✅ Updated `db/schema.ts` with all new fields
- ✅ Added TypeScript types for intelligence tables

### Features Now in Database
**Basic**: tempo, musicalKey, musicalMode, timeSignature

**Harmonic**: harmonicComplexity, harmonicEntropy, dominantFrequencies, spectralCentroid, spectralRolloff

**Rhythmic**: rhythmicComplexity, syncopation, groove, beatStrength

**Timbral**: brightness, roughness, warmth, spectralFlux

**Emotional**: energy, valence, arousal, tension

**Structural**: sectionCount, repetitionScore, noveltyScore, dynamicRange

**Meta**: danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness

**Quality**: loudness, zeroCrossingRate, rms

## 🔄 In Progress

### Upload Route Update
- Updating `server/routes/music.ts` to store ALL features
- Currently only stores 7 fields, needs to store all 30+

### Intelligence Engine Rewrite
- Rewriting `music-intelligence.ts` to read from database
- Removing all mock/random data generation
- Implementing real statistical analysis

## ⏳ Next Steps

1. **Update Music Upload Route** - Store all extracted features
2. **Fix Intelligence Engine** - Read features from DB instead of mocking
3. **Run Database Migration** - Apply schema changes
4. **Test Upload Flow** - Verify features flow end-to-end
5. **Implement Pattern Detection** - Real statistical algorithms
6. **Add Hypothesis Testing** - Bayesian updating
7. **Calculate Real Phi** - Consciousness metrics
