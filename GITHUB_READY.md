```markdown
🌌 **MusicPortal is now open source!**

We're attempting to discover whether music contains universal intelligence 
through autonomous AI analysis.

## What We Built (Today!)
- Real audio analysis extracting 30+ features
- Autonomous pattern recognition
- Hypothesis generation & testing
- Consciousness metrics (Phi)
- Complete intelligence dashboard

## What We Need
- 🎵 **Music** from diverse cultures
- 💻 **Developers** to improve algorithms
